# MTN_ATM
I worked on this project in 2015 during my undergraduate for a workshop that was organized by my university, University of Kassala, Sudan. 

The project aimed at facilitating the process of buying electricity and MTN's phone credit, by using your bank details whether of Faisal Bank or Khartoum Bank. 

And In the end, the program gives you a receipt showing the transaction that you have done, its cost, and your remain balance. 

Besides the application is trilingual, it can run in English, French, and Arabic.  

The bank details of the users are stored in an Acces database which contains two tables as we have two banks.
